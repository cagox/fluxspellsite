* Currently, pageBody is a value in <App /> that is being set to a specific value based on the page type.
  Realistically it is just a stub that will do that eventually, but maybe that is the wrong direction overall.
  pageBody could become <PageBody />, and be passed props based on the state of App. The state would be mannaged
  at the top level with callbacks to handle changes that need to be made to the state.

* Currently I am using links in the SchoolsHeader element. These can apparently be turned into buttons that look
  like links. This would make it easier to attach an onClick method to make changes to the state without reloading
  the entire page.
