* Currently I am using links in the SchoolsHeader element. These can apparently be turned into buttons that look
  like links. This would make it easier to attach an onClick method to make changes to the state without reloading
  the entire page. It would apparently also be more compatible with screen readers and the like.

* At the moment it visually looks close to what we want. It needs tweeking still. For one, the form element will
  most likely get removed and replaced by a click handler that accepts the school_id as a parameter, setting
  page to "schoolView" and school_id to school_id in the App state.

  Look at this for examples: https://linguinecode.com/post/how-to-pass-parameter-values-to-onclick-react-function

  Eventually the same will be usable for Types and even spells.






  Example CSS: (This will have to be modified to fit our theme.)

  body {
  	font-family: "Verdana" sans-serif;
  }

  button {
  	overflow: visible;
  	width: auto;
  }

  button.link {
  	font-family: "Verdana" sans-serif;
  	font-size: 1em;
  	text-align: left;
  	color: blue;
  	background: none;
  	margin: 0;
  	padding: 0;
  	border: none;
  	cursor: pointer;

  	-moz-user-select: text;
  	display:inline;
  }

  /*
  button.link span {
  	text-decoration: underline;
  }
  */

  button.link:hover span,
  button.link:focus span {
  	color: black;
  }

  form.link {
  	display:inline;
  }
